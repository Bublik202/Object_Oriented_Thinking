# Object-Oriented Thinking
The purpose of this task is to gain hands-on experience of how to understand requirements for a chosen system and design class diagrams by picturing classes.

The task should be submitted as txt, doc, rtf, docx, or pdf attachment.

It will take you about 3 hours to complete the task; so, occasionally, take a break to clear your head.

Please be aware that the task status is mandatory.

## Task Description
1. Select from the following options the system for which the class hierarchy will be developed.
  Table or Card Games simulations:
  - Chess
  - Checkers
  - Narde
  - Go
  ...
2. Publicly available devices/services:
  - a public printer/copier at a university
  - a public coffee/vending machine at a
  - university/dormitory/hospital/street
  - a public phone booth on a street
  ...
3. Scheduling/Management systems:
  - Dormitory accommodation management
  - Zoo animals' nutrition management
  - Robotized warehouse management
  ...

Please read carefully and do the following:
1. Describe the requirements for the chosen system: functional and non-functional.
2. Design use cases for the system based on the requirements.
3. Identify objects, classes, and relationships in the system. Optionally, design CRC cards.
4. Design class diagrams picturing classes, their attributes, and relations in the system.
5. Optionally, convert diagrams into Java code.
6. Send the following results: requirements, use cases, CRCs (optional), class diagrams, Java code of the classes.
